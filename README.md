# RF-WiFi-Bridge-Based-on-ESP32

<div align="center"><a href="#"><img src="Images/8.png" width="400" ></a><br><br></div>
This RF Bridge can convert most of the 433.92MHz RF Remotes into WiFi wireless, It can be used for most of the 433.92MHz RF Remote controlled products, like RF controlled switch, RF controlled socket, RF controlled bulb, RF controlled door opener, etc.

Even more exciting is that it will work with the 433.92MHz door magnetic sensor, 433.92MHz human body IR sensor, and more other 433.92MHz sensors to realize security alarm.

With this project, you can easily control your home appliances and security systems remotely using your smartphone or tablet.

One of the advantages of this project is that it is easy to install and use. You don't need any special technical skills or knowledge to set it up. All you need is a WiFi network, a smartphone or tablet, and a few minutes of your time. Once it's set up, you can control your home appliances and security systems from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection.

In addition, this project is also cost-effective. It is much cheaper than buying new smart home devices to replace your existing RF remote controlled products. With this project, you can upgrade your home to a smart home without spending a lot of money.

The system is built using an ESP32 microcontroller, a RF transceiver and Tasmota firmware.

ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller that's commonly used in IoT projects due to its low cost, low power consumption, and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. The ESP32 can be used to process data from various sensors and modules, making it a perfect choice for a home security system. [refrence](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)

Tasmota firmware is an open-source firmware for ESP8266 and ESP32-based devices that provides a web interface for configuration and control of the device. It's designed to be easy to use and highly configurable, making it a popular choice for DIY IoT projects. [refrence](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)

<br/>
The system can also be integrated with other smart home devices, such as smart lights and smart locks. This allows the user to control the security system and other smart home devices from a single interface.

Overall, an IoT security gadget based on ESP3 and Tasmota is a simple yet effective solution for detect any unauthorized entry into a place even during power outages.

### This project has been tested more than 8000 hours...


## IoT mobile application for project

This IoT mobile app is built with ionic framework, JavaScript and MQTT protocol and is designed to communicate with IoT devices in a network using the MQTT protocol to exchange data. The app is specifically built for Android platforms using JavaScript and can run on various Android devices.

The MQTT protocol is a lightweight messaging protocol that's commonly used in IoT applications. It's designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency networks and can handle a large number of devices simultaneously. The MQTT protocol allows IoT devices to communicate with each other and with the app, exchanging data in real-time.

## Features

-  Tasmota firmware:
    -  Tasmota firmware is an open-source firmware for ESP8266 and ESP32-based devices that provides a web interface for configuration and control of the device. It's designed to be easy to use and highly configurable, making it a popular choice for DIY IoT projects. [refrence](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)

-  PIR Sensor:
    -  The PIR sensor is a motion sensor that detects changes in infrared radiation in its field of view. The ESP32 microcontroller can process the data from the PIR sensor and trigger various actions and alerts based on the data.
      
-  Internal battery:
    -  The internal battery is a rechargeable battery that's built into the system, providing power to the system for an extended period, even if there's a power outage.

 -  External USB port:
    -  USB port for connecting all types of internet modems that have 5V power supply.

 -  IOT:
    -  Sending and receiving information with the MQTT protocol for any device or person.

 -  Call and SMS:
    -  Sending SMS and calls  to mobile phones through the server.
